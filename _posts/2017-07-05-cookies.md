Webstrates has a built-in cookie mechanism that allows logged in users to persist JavaScript objects
across devices. There are two kinds of cookies: "anywhere" cookies, which may be accessed and
modified from any webstrate the user is accessing, and document-bound cookies ("here"), only
available from the webstrate they were created in.

The cookies are simple key-value stores persisted on the server and distributed to the user's
connected clients. Any serializable JavaScript object can be stored in cookies. To set an "anywhere"
cookie `foo` with the value `bar`, call:

```javascript
webstrate.user.cookies.anywhere.set("foo", "bar");
```

To retrieve it again (possibly in another webstrate, from another device the user is logged in to),
the application/user may call:

```javascript
webstrate.user.cookies.anywhere.get("foo");
```

and get back `bar`. "here" cookies are managed in a similar fashion through
`webstrate.cookies.here.set()` and `webstrate.cookies.here.get()`.

To retrieve all cookies, call `get()` without any parameters on either the `here` or `anywhere`
object.

Cookies can only be saved for logged-in users, hence their placement on the `webstrate.user` object,
which won't exist for non-logged in users.

Listening for cookie updates can be done by subscribing to `cookieUpdateHere` and
`cookieUpdateAnywhere` events, e.g.:

```javascript
webstrate.on("cookieUpdateHere", function(key, value) {
  // A cookie key-value pair was added/updated.
});
```

Note that contrary to HTTP cookies, the cookies' contents are stored on the server; only the session
token (the user's credentials) are stored in an actual HTTP cookie. A value set on one client will
therefore be persisted to all of the user's other connected clients (other computers, tablets,
etc.).
