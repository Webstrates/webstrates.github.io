The user may subscribe to certain events triggered by Webstrates using `webstrate.on(event, function)` (the webstrate instance) or `DOMElement.webstrate.on(event, function)` (the webstrate object attached to every DOM element). When an event occurs, the attached function will be triggered with potential arguments.

## Trigger event when a webstrate has finished loading

When the Webstrates client has finished loading a webstrate, it will trigger a `loaded` event on the Webstrate instance. Using the default `client.html` and `client.js`,  the webstrate instance will be attached to the window element as `window.webstrate`. Thus, a user may attach events to `webstrate.on`:

```javascript
webstrate.on("loaded", function(webstrateId, clientId, user) {
  // The Webstrates client has now finished loading.
});
```

If a webstrate has been transcluded (i.e. loaded in an iframe), a `transcluded` event will be triggered, both within the transcluded iframe, but also on the iframe element itself:

```javascript
var myIframe = document.createElement("iframe");
myIframe.src = "/some_webstrate";
myIframe.webstrate.on("transcluded", function(webstrateId, clientId, user) {
  // The webstrate client in the iframe has now finished loading.
});
document.body.appendChild(myIframe);
```

If the client is logged in using a passport provider (like GitHub), `user` will be an object containinig a `userId`, `username`, `provider` and `displayName`. This object is also available on the global `webstrate` instance as `webstrate.user`.

## Events on text nodes

Webstrates does fine-grained synchronization on text nodes and attributes, however, to update a text node or attribute in the browser, the whole text is replaced. To allow more fine-grained interaction with text, Webstrates also dispatches text insertion and deletion events on text nodes and element nodes:

```javascript
textNode.webstrate.on("insertText", function(position, value) {
  // Some text has just been inserted into textNode by another client.
});

textNode.webstrate.on("deleteText", function(position, value) {
  // Some text has just been deleted from textNode by another client.
});

elementNode.webstrate.on("insertText", function(position, value, attributeName) {
  // Some text has just been inserted into an attribute on elementNode by another client.
});

elementNode.webstrate.on("deleteText", function(position, value, attributeName) {
  // Some text has just been deleted from an attribute on textNode by another client.
});
```

## Added and removed nodes

Listening for added or removed nodes can be done using `nodeAdded` and `nodeRemoved`:

```javascript
parentElement.webstrate.on("nodeAdded", function(node) {
  // A DOM node was added by another client.
});

parentElement.webstrate.on("nodeRemoved", function(node) {
  // A DOM node was removed by another client.
});
```

## Changing attributes

Attribute changes will trigger `attributeChanged`:

```javascript
childElement.webstrate.on("attributeChanged", function(attributeName, oldValue, newValue) {
  // An attribute was changed by another client.
});
```

If the attribute has just been added, `oldValue` will be `undefined`. If an attribute has just been removed, `newValue` will be `undefined`. If an attribute has just been updated, `oldValue` and `newValue` will contain what you'd expect.

## Prime events

DOM events come in two flavors, regular events and prime events.

The regular events (e.g. `nodeAdded`) only get triggered when another client is the cause of the event trigger, but prime events (e.g. `nodeAdded*`) get triggered regardless of who caused it.

If a user adds an element to the DOM, both the `nodeAdded` and `nodeAdded*` events will get triggered on the other clients.
However, only the `nodeAdded*` event will get triggered on the client that inserted the DOM element.

To distinguish between event triggers caused by the user himself and other users, the `local` parameter can be used.
The `local` parameter will be `true` if the DOM change was caused by the current client (current browser) or `falsy` if it originated elsewhere.

```javascript
parentElement.webstrate.on("nodeAdded", function(node) {
  // A DOM node was added by another client.
});

parentElement.webstrate.on("nodeAdded*", function(node, local) {
  if (local) {
    // A DOM node was added by this client.
  } else {
    // A DOM node was added by another client.
  }
});
```

## Unregistering event listeners

All the events can also be unregistered using `off`, e.g.:

```javascript
webstrate.on("loaded", function loadedFunction() {
  // Work here...
  webstrate.off("loaded", loadedFunction);
});
```
