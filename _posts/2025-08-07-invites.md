For webstrates owned by logged-in users, they can generate invitations to other users that will 
permanently grant read, read+write or admin permissions. Only logged-in users can use invites.
Accepting such an invitation allows the receiving user to add themselves to the webstrate permission 
list with the permissions given in the invitation.

In comparison with [Access Tokens](/userguide/api/access-tokens.html), an invite can be sent to many 
users and only expires once its validity runs out - which happens if the sender is no longer an 
admin on the webstrate or if the invite expires. Also, the receiver does not become the sending user.

An invite can be generated by any logged in user with admin rights on a webstrate by using the invites API
located in the `webstrate.user.invites` object.

Once generated, the invite key can be shared using whatever method - for example in 
the form of a URL in an email, over chat or social media, programmatically as a signal, ...

## Generating an Invitation

This example code will create a read-only invitation with a 300 second expiry when run in the developer tools console:

```javascript
```

## Using Invitations

- Check invite
It is possible to check the validity of an invitation and receive additional information about it if it is
still valid.
```json
{
}
```

- Accept invite
When accepting an invitation on a webstrate where the accepting user already has some permissions the
permissions will be merged with the one from the invite.


To access a webstrate using an invite, you can also put the invite key in the query string. For the above
example:

```
/my-secret-webstrate/?????=....
```

## Managing your Active Invitations

A list of all currently active invites created by the currently logged-in user on the current webstrate can be generated using
```javascript
```

Cancelling an invitation can be done using

```javascript
```

## Advanced Usage

All of the API methods default to working on the currently loaded webstrate.
By adding the webstrate ID of another webstrate as an argument to any of the calls, however, they can 
be used to create, list, accept, etc. invites for any other webstrate located on the same server - 
with the same usage rules as above, naturally.

This is useful for creating applications where a portion of the application logic
is on a read-only publically accessible webstrate and another portion (of the logic
or data) is stored in personal webstrates owned by individual users.

For example this code will create a read+write invitation for another webstrate than the currently
loaded one:
```javascript
```
