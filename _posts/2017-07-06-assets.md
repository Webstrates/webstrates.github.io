Webstrates supports the attachment of assets (files). Files can be attached to a Webstrate by
performing a POST request with a file (or multiple files) to the webstrate's path:

```html
<form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="file">
  <input type="submit" value="Upload">
</form>
```

The `action` attribute in the above is the empty string (`""`), meaning the form will submit to
itself. When adding the above code to a webstrate at `/myWebstrate/`, and submitting the form with a
file, the request will be made to `/myWebstrate/` and the file added to myWebstrate. Submitting to
another webstrate is also possible by changing the `action` attribute.

Note that forms *must* have `enctype="multipart/form-data"` to be recognized by the Webstrates
server.

## Adding assets

Uploading an asset will attach it to the current version of the document, but may also be accessed
by future versions, assuming no other asset has been added with the same name since.

For instance,
uploading `cow.jpg` at version 1 to myWebstrate will make it possible to access it at
`/myWebstrate/cow.jpg`, `/myWebstrate/1/cow.jpg`, `/myWebstrate/2/cow.jpg` etc., assuming those
versions exist.

If, however, another `cow.jpg` is uploaded at version 3, any requests to
`/myWebstrate/3/cow.jpg`, `/myWebstrate/4/cow.jpg` and so forth will refer to the new `cow.jpg`, but
any requests to previous versions will still refer to the old `cow.jpg`.

Accessing
`/myWebstrate/cow.jpg` will naturally always point to the newest version of `cow.jpg`.

Copying and restoring Webstrates will also take the assets into account and perform as expected:
Copying a webstrate will also copy over the assets to the new webstrate, so deleting the source
webstrate won't result in the assets in the new webstrate disappearing. Restoring a webstrate will
bump the version of the older assets (e.g. the first version of `cow.jpg`) to the version of the
restored webstrate.

When submitting an asset, the server will return a JSON object representing the asset, e.g.:

```json
{
  "v": 128,
  "fileName": "cow.jpg",
  "fileSize": 138666,
  "mimeType": "image/jpg",
  "identifier": "eddc9c8937d6447c550433c5a3f20a65"
}
```

In the above example, we have uploaded an image `cow.jpg` with a size of 135 KB (138666 bytes) to
version 128 of the document (the current version). The assets has also been given the unique
identifier `eddc9c8937d6447c550433c5a3f20a65` in the system. When copying/restoring webstrates,
files may get different version numbers, making it hard to keep track of a specific version of an
asset. The identifier solves this, as the identifier always refers to the same version of an asset.

Note that an asset is always attached to the newest version of a webstrate, because the philosophy
of Webstrates is to never modify the history of a document, but only append to it. Adding an asset
to a previous version would modify the history of the document. For the same reason, restoring a
webstrate also doesn't modify the history, but only appends to it. Assets cannot be deleted, except
by deleting the entire document.

## Accessing assets

All assets for a webstrate can be listed by making a GET request to `/<webstrateId>/?assets` or by
calling `webstrate.assets`. Additionally, it is possible to get notified whenever an asset is
added to the webstrate. This is done by listening for the `asset` event:

```javascript
webstrate.on("asset", function(asset) {
  // Asset was added to the webstrate.
});
```

The asset object will be similar to the one shown above.
