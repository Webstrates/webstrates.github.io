Developing with Webstrates is fundamentally different from traditional web development, so it'll be
easier to get started with a couple of tutorials. The tutorials are all located in the [Webstrates
tutorials repository on Github](//github.com/Webstrates/tutorials/):

1. **[Collaborative Notes](//github.com/Webstrates/tutorials/tree/master/collaborative-notes)** An
introduction to Webstrates, its tools, and transclusion.
2. **[Chat System](//github.com/Webstrates/tutorials/tree/master/chat-system)** A chat system with
private messaging, utilizing [`<transient>` tags](/userguide/api/transient.html) and
[signaling](/userguide/api/signaling.html).
3. **[Notebook](//github.com/Webstrates/tutorials/tree/master/notebook)** A notebook also utilizing
`<transient>` tags, transclusion, as well as
[tagging](/userguide/api/tagging.html).
4. **[Pad](//github.com/Webstrates/tutorials/tree/master/pad)** A basic implementation of a zoomable
canvas utilizing "external webstrates" and other features introduced in previous tutorials.

It is highly recommended that you start out with
[Collaborative Notes](//github.com/Webstrates/tutorials/tree/master/collaborative-notes), as it also
introduces some useful tools for developing Webstrates.
