The _HTTP API_ is the collective name for all Webstrates operations that can be performed with HTTP
GET requests. These operations allow the user to create and copy webstrates, access the history of a
webstrate, as well as the webstrate's meta data, such as assets, tags and operations history.

## Creation of webstrates

* GET on `http://<hostname>/<webstrateId>/?copy` will create a new webstrate with a random id using
the webstrate `<webstrateId>` as a prototype (i.e. copying over the webstrate).
* GET on `http://<hostname>/<webstrateId>?copy=<newWebstrateId>` will create a new webstrate with id
`<newWebstrateId>` using the webstrate `<webstrateId>` as prototype.
* GET on `http://<hostname>/<webstrateId>/<versionOrTag>/?copy=<newWebstrateId>` will create a new
webstrate with id `<newWebstrateId>` using version or tag `<versionOrTag>` of the webstrate
`<webstrateId>` as prototype. If the `?copy` value is left out, a random id will be generated.
* GET on `http://<hostname>/new?prototypeUrl=<someURL>&id=<newWebstrateId>` will create a new
webstrate (either with a random id or `<nweWebstrateId>` if provided), containing the contents of
`<someURL>`. If the provided URL points to a ZIP file, the server will extract the ZIP, replace the
DOM with the contents of the `index.html` and add all remaining files from the ZIP to the document
as assets. `<someURL>` must be a fully qualified URL.

When using `prototypeUrl`, it is the _source code_ returned from the server that is being copied,
not the DOM. Therefore, when naively prototyping from another Webstrates server, the resulting
webstrate created would contain the Webstrates server's `client.html`, not the actual webstrate. To
overcome this, use the `?raw` parameter.

Alternatively, the `?prototypeUrl` feature may be combined with the `?dl` feature on another server.
E.g. to transfer a webstrate with assets from one Webstrate server to another, one might call:
`http://<targetServer>/new?prototypeUrl=http://<sourceServer>/<webstrateId>?dl` to copy
`<webstrateId>` from `<sourceServer>` to `<targetServer>`. If `<sourceServer>` uses <a
href="/userguide/server-config.html#server-level-basic-authentication">basic auth</a>, remember to
include those in the URL.

<div class="info box">
	When copying a webstrate that the copier doesn't have
	<a href="/userguide/permissions">permissions</a> to modify (read), one of two things will happen:
	<ul>
		<li>If the user is logged in, the read-write permissions are added to the permissions list
		of the copied webstrate. Note that the original permissions persist in the copy.</li>
		<li>If the user isn't logged in, the permissions will be wiped from the webstrate, so the
		webstrate uses the <a href="/userguide/permissions#defaults">default permissions</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	Note that it's not possible to copy a webstrate in which the user doesn't have read permissions,
	either explicitly in the <code>data-auth</code>, or implicitly by falling back to default
	permissions.
</div>

**Legacy operations**

The below operations are still supported, but may disappear at any time. All features provided by
these legacy operations are also available through the non-legacy API.

* GET on `http://<hostname>/new?prototype=<webstrateId>` will create a new webstrate with a random
id using the webstrate `<webstrateId>` as prototype.
* GET on `http://<hostname>/new?prototype=<webstrateId>&id=<newWebstrateId>` will create a new
webstrate with id `<newWebstrateId>` using the webstrate `<webstrateId>` as prototype.
* GET on `http://<hostname>/new?prototype=<webstrateId>&v=<version>&id=<newWebstrateId>` will create
a new webstrate with id `<newWebstrateId>` using version `<version>` of the webstrate
`<webstrateId>` as prototype. If the `?id` value is left out, a random id will be generated.

## Accessing the history of a webstrate

* GET on `http://<hostname>/<webstrateId>/?v` will return the version number of `<webstrateId>`.
* GET on `http://<hostname>/<webstrateId>?tags` will return a list of tags associated with
`<webstrateId>`.
* GET on `http://<hostname>/<webstrateId>?ops` will return a list of all operations applied to
`<webstrateId>` (Beware: this can be a huge list).
* GET on `http://<hostname>/<webstrateId>/?static` will return a static version of webstrate
`<webstrateId>`.

<div class="info box">
	<p>When accessing a `static` version of a document, Webstrates serves `client.html` as per usual,
	and the webstrate requested is also generated on the client similar to how it is done for normal
	requests. Any changes made to the webstrate, however, are not persisted or shared between clients.
	</p>
</div>

* GET on `http://<hostname>/<webstrateId>/<versionOrTag>/` will return a static version of webstrate
`<webstrateId>` at version or tag `<versionOrTag>`.
* GET on `http://<hostname>/<webstrateId>/?raw` will return a raw version of webstrate
`<webstrateId>`.

<div class="info box">
	<p>On normal requests, the Webstrates server serves a static <code>client.html</code> with
	JavaScripts that replace the DOM with the content of the webstrate.</p>

	<p>When using the <code>raw</code> parameter, the Webstrates server instead serves the raw HTML.
	No Webstrates JavaScript is executed on the client side, and no WebSocket connection is
	established. This also means that DOM elements do not have attached <code>webstrate</code>
	objects, and as a result you cannot listen for Webstrate events, etc.</p>
</div>

* GET on `http://<hostname>/<webstrateId>/<versionOrTag>/?raw` will return a raw version of webstrate
`<webstrateId>` at version or tag `<versionOrTag>`.
* GET on `http://<hostname>/<webstrateId>/?dl` will return a ZIP (or TAR with `?dl=tar`) archive of
webstrate `<webstrateId>`.
* GET on `http://<hostname>/<webstrateId>/<versionOrTag>/?dl` will return a ZIP (or TAR with
`?dl=tar`) archive of webstrate `<webstrateId>` at version or tag `<versionOrTag>`.

## Assets

* GET on `http://<hostname>/<webstrateId>?assets` will return a list of assets (uploaded files)
associated with `<webstrateId>`.

Assets can be attached to a webstrate by performing a POST request with a file (or multiple files)
to the webstrateâ€™s path.

Note that forms _must_ have `enctype="multipart/form-data"` to be recognized by the Webstrates
server.

For more information on assets, see the [Assets section](/userguide/api/assets.html).

## Access tokens

* GET on `http://<hostname>/<webstrateId>/?tokens` will return a list of all active access tokens.

The creation of access tokens is done by performing a POST request to the webstrate the access token
is needed for, containing a `token` field. The value of the token field will be used as the token
duration in seconds. If the value is not a positive integer, it defaults to 300 seconds.

For more information on access tokens, see the
[Access Tokens section](/userguide/api/access-tokens.html).

## Restoring a webstrate

* GET on `http://<hostname>/<webstrateId>?restore=<versionOrTag>` restores the document to look like
it did in version or tag `<versionOrTag>` and redirects the user to `/<webstrateId>`. This will
apply operations on the current verison until the desired version is reached and will therefore not
break the operations log or remove from it, but only add additional operations.

<div class="info box">
	<p>A webstrate can also be restored using
		<code><a href="/userguide/api/restore">webstrate.restore()</a></code>.
	</p>
</div>

## Deleting a webstrate

* GET on `http://<hostname>/<webstrateId>?delete` will delete the document and redirect all
connected users to the server root. The webstrate data including operations history, tags, assets,
etc. will all be completely and unrecoverably deleted.
