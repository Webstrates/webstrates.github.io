Webstrates ships with a sample configuration file
([`config-sample.json`](https://github.com/Webstrates/Webstrates/blob/master/config-sample.json))
that gets copied over to `config.json` if no `config.json` file is present when Webstrates starts.

## Basic settings

|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Property           | Description                                | Default                               |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `listeningAddress` | IP address to listen on.                   | `0.0.0.0` (all addresses)             |
| `listeningPort`    | Port to listen on.                         | `7777`                                |
| `db`               | MongoDB connection url.                    | `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/webstrate` |
| `maxAge`           | How long static files should be cached (not assets). Defined in milliseconds or using [ms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms) format. | `1d` (24 hours) |
| `rateLimit`        | [Configuration object for rate limiting](#rate-limiting) | See [`config-sample.json`](https://github.com/Webstrates/Webstrates/blob/master/config-sample.json). |
| `basicdAuth`       | [Configuration object for basic auth](#server-level-basic-authentication) | See [`config-sample.json`](https://github.com/Webstrates/Webstrates/blob/master/config-sample.json). |
| `pubsub`           | Reddis connection url (multithreading).    | unset                                 |
| `threads`          | Number of threads to use (multihtreading). | unset                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|

## Rate limiting

To avoid having clients DoS'ing the server unintentionally by having faulty Webstrates application
code, sending thousands of messages to the server per second, Webstrates allows for rate limiting
the number of requests.

Operations are generally a lot heavier on the server than other kinds of messages (keep alive,
signals, cookie changes, user messages), so these can be configured separately.

- `opsPerInterval` defines the number of operations allowed within the defined interval.
- `signalsPerInterval` defines the number of signals (and other kind of messages) allowed within
the defined interval.
- `intervalLength` defines the interval i milliseconds.
- `banDuration` defines the ban duration in milliseconds.

A decent configuration may be something like below, which allows 500 operations and 2000 signals
over a 15 second period:

```json
"rateLimit": {
  "opsPerInterval": 500,
  "signalsPerInterval": 2000,
  "intervalLength": 15000,
  "banDuration": 30000
}
```

With the above, the server will disconnect and ban any client (by IP) for 30 seconds if they exceed
the limitation.

## Authentication

### Server level basic authentication
To enable basic HTTP authentication on the Webstrates server, add the following to `config.json`:

```json
"basicAuth": {
  "realm": "Webstrates",
  "username": "some_username",
  "password": "some_password"
}
```

### Per-webstrate permissions
It is possible to enable per webstrate access rights using [GitHub](https://github.com) as authentication provider.
This requires [registering an OAuth application with GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). Afterwards, access to a specific webstrate may be restricted to a specific set of GitHub users.

Add the following to your `config.json`:

```json
"auth": {
  "providers": {
    "github": {
      "node_module": "passport-github",
      "config": {
        "clientID": "<github client id>",
        "clientSecret": "<github secret>",
        "callbackURL": "http://<hostname>/auth/github/callback"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Access rights are added to a webstrate as a `data-auth` attribute on the `<html>` tag:

```html
<html data-auth='[{"username": "cklokmose", "provider": "github", "permissions": "rw"},
  {"username": "anonymous", "provider": "", "permissions": "r"}]'>
...
</html>
```

The above example provides the user with GitHub username *cklokmose* permissions to read and write (`rw`), while anonymous users only have read (`r`) access.

Users can log in by accessing `http://<hostname>/auth/github`.

In the future, more authentication providers will be supported.

### Default permissions

It is also possible to set default permissions. Adding the following under the `auth` section in `config.json` will apply the same permissions as above to all webstrates without a `data-auth` property.

```json
"defaultPermissions": [
  {"username": "cklokmose", "provider": "github", "permissions": "rw"},
  {"username": "anonymous", "provider": "", "permissions": "r"}
]
```

### Permission timeout

To increase performance, permissions are cached in the system. When the `data-auth` property of a
webstrate is modified, the cache is invalidated. However, as a failsafe, permissions also time out
after a set period of time. This can be configured with `auth.permissionTimeout`, which defines the
number of seconds permissions can be remain cached before they need to be revalidated. (default
300 seconds).

### Cookie

Webstrates uses cookies to save the user's credentials. The cookie's name (`cookieName`), encryption
key (`secret`) and life time (`duration`) can be configured. The `duration` is defined in
milliseconds and defaults to 31536000000 (365 days).

While the default `cookieName` and `duration` are fine, the `secret` _should_ be changed by the user
before running Webstrates! Any random text string of 30+ characters is sufficient.

```json
"cookie": {
  "secret": "This is a secret",
  "cookieName": "session",
  "duration": 31536000000
}
```

## Multi-threading

To enable multithreading, Redis must be installed (to be used for publish/subscribe between
threads) and the config must contain to properties, namely:

- `pubsub` which must be set to the Redis connection url, and
- `threads` which must contain the number of desired threads.

For example:

```json
  "pubsub": "redis://localhost:6379/",
  "threads": 4
```

If `threads` is set to 0, Webstrates will automatically create one thread for each CPU core.

## Tagging

[Auto-tagging](/userguide/api/tagging.html#auto-tagging) can also be configured. Currently, only
very basic configuration is possible, namely:

- `autoTagInterval` which defines how long a webstrate must have been "inactive" (without ops) for
it to become autotagged on next action (default 3600 seconds (60 minutes)).
- `tagPrefix` defines the prefix of the tag that'll be created (default "Session of ").

```json
  "tagging": {
    "autotagInterval": 3600,
    "tagPrefix": "Session of "
  },
```

Tags are postfixed with the current date time, so a tag might look something like:
"Session of Thu Jun 29 2017 14:03:30 GMT+0200 (CEST)".
