The God API allows services to listen to real-time activity taking place on a Webstrates server through a websocket
connection.

To enable the God API, define a God API key in the [Server Config](/userguide/server-config.html) and then restart the
Webstrates server. Afterwards, the God API will be available at `ws://localhost:7007/ws?noop`. (The `?noop` is added to
prevent the server from handling this connection as a regular Webstrates websocket connection. )

All commands sent to the server must include the `ga` (God Action) key and a command for the server.

To authenticate with the server, send a JSON object `key` command along with the key defined in the server config.

```json
{ "ga": "key", "key": "<key>" }
```

Afterwards, you may subscribe to subjects. A subject is either a webstrateId, a userId, or a list of either. For each
subject, you may subscribe to one (or all) of three types of events:

- `dom` -- DOM changes. If subscribing to a user, this is all DOM changes caused by the user. If subscribing to a
  webstrate, this is all DOM changes happening in the webstrate.
- `user` -- [User actions.](/userguide/api/client-management.html#client-join-and-part-events) If subscribing to a user,
  this is any joins and parts the user performs. If subscribing to a webstrate, this is joins and parts occuring in the
  seecific webstrate.
- `signal` -- [Signals.](/userguide/api/signaling.html) If subscribing to a user, this is any signals sent by the user.
   If subscribing to a webstrate, this is signals sent within a webstrate. (Keep in mind that -- as an optimization --
   if a signal is sent in a webstrate with no receivers, it will not be transmitted to the server, and thus not be
   registered by the God API either.)

## A few examples

To subscribe to webstrates, the `subscribeWebstrate` command must be used, along with a webstrateId (or array of
webstrateIds). Additionally, a `filter` must be provided, containing any of the three events (`dom`, `user`, `signal`).
As with the webstrates, this can be a single string value or an array.

Additionally, all subscriptions must include a `subscriptionId`, which can be any string. A randomly generated string is
suitable.

A subscription to all DOM changes in the webstrate `honest-kangaroo-9` may therefore look something like:

```json
{
  "ga": "subscribeWebstrate",
  "subscriptionId": "45czu6mbbqo",
  "webstrates": "honest-kangaroo-9",
  "filter": "dom"
}
```

And to subscribe to multiple webstrates (e.g. `frontpage` and `other`) and events (e.g. `user` and `signal`) at once:

```json
{
  "ga": "subscribeWebstrate",
  "subscriptionId": "45czu6mbbqo",
  "webstrates": ["frontpage", "other"],
  "filter": ["user", "signal"]
}
```

To subscribe to a user (or multiple), the `users` value must be defined as either a single userId (or an array of
userIds). A subscription to all signals from userId `kbadk:github` could look like this:

```json
{
  "ga": "subscribeUser",
  "subscriptionId": "45czu6mbbqo",
  "users": "kbadk:github",
  "filter": "signal"
}
```

## A NodeJS example

To use the below example NodeJS must be installed on the machine. To get started, create a new folder with a file
`index.js` containing the code below. Modify the file with correct server host (line 80) and key (line 35), then run:

    npm install --prefix . websocket

To install the websocket package in the current folder, followed by running:

    node index.js

The script will create the three subscriptions used in the above examples, i.e. subscriptions to:

- All DOM changes to webstrate `honest-kangaroo-9`.
- All user joins/parts as well as signals in the webstrates `frontpage` and `other`.
- All signals sent by userId `kbadk:github`.

The events matching any of the three subscriptions will be logged to the console when the script is running.

```javascript
const WebSocketClient = require('websocket').client;

const client = new WebSocketClient();

const timestamp = () => (new Date()).toLocaleTimeString();
const log = (...args) => console.log(`[${timestamp()}]`, ...args);
const error = (...args) => console.error(`[${timestamp()}]`, ...args);

client.on('connectFailed', error => {
  log(error.toString());
});

client.on('connect', conn => {

  log('Connected.');

  conn.on('error', error => {
    error(error.toString());
  });

  conn.on('message', message => {
    if (message.type === 'utf8') {
      log('↓', message.utf8Data);
    }
  });

  const send = (msg, silent) => {
    msg = JSON.stringify(msg);
    !silent && log( '↑', msg);
    conn.sendUTF(msg);
  };

  // Authenticate ourselves with the God API key defined in config.json.
  send({ ga: 'key', key: '<key goes here>' });

  // Each connection requires a unique subscrptionId. We just generate a pseudo-random string.
  const subscriptionId = Math.random().toString(36).substr(2)

  // You can subscribe to DOM changes, signals or user actions (join/part) for either a specific
  // user or a specific webstrate.

  // Subscribe all all DOM changes in the webstrate honest-kangaroo-9 by any user.
  send({
    ga: 'subscribeWebstrate',
    subscriptionId,
    webstrates: 'honest-kangaroo-9',
    filter: 'dom'
  });

  // Subscribe to any join/part or signals by any user in two webstrates: frontpage and other.
  send({
    ga: 'subscribeWebstrate',
    subscriptionId,
    webstrates: ['frontpage', 'other'],
    filter: ['user', 'signal']
  });

  // Subscribe to any signals sent by user kbadk:github regardless of webstrate.
  send({
    ga: 'subscribeUser',
    subscriptionId,
    users: 'kbadk:github',
    filter: 'signal'
  });

  // Websocket will automatically close after 30 seconds of inactivity. Send keep alive message
  // every 25 seconds.
  setInterval(() => {
    send({ type: 'alive' }, true);
  }, 25 * 1000)

  conn.on('close', (code, reason) => {
    log(`Closed: ${reason} (code ${code})`);
  });

});

// `?noop` to establishing a connection with ShareDB.
client.connect('wss://<host of server>/ws/?noop');
```
