## [Events](/userguide/api/events.html)

The user may subscribe to certain events triggered by Webstrates, allowing the user to get notified
when Webstrates has loaded, an element changes, a user joins, a signal arrives, etc.

## [Transient](/userguide/api/transient.html)

Transient data is temporary, local data, i.e. data that does not get persisted or synchronized to
other clients, and disappears on reload. Transient data is made through transient elements and
attributes.

## [Cookies](/userguide/api/cookies.html)

Webstrates has a built-in cookie mechanism that allows logged in users to persist JavaScript objects
across devices.

## [Assets](/userguide/api/assets.html)

Assets or files) can be attached to webstrates through POST requests. Just like webstrates, assets
are versioned.

## [Signaling](/userguide/api/signaling.html)

Send messages to other connected users through DOM elements, both primitive (serializable) objects,
but also WebRTC-based peer-to-peer data streaming.

## [Messaging](/userguide/api/messaging.html)

Messaging allows users to send cross-webstrate messages between users, even when a user isn’t
online. It’s basically emails for Webstrates.

## [Tagging](/userguide/api/tagging.html)

To easier manage versions of webstrate documents, Webstrates implements tagging. Tagging allows
users to attach unique string identifiers (tag labels) to specific versions of a webstrate.

## [Access Tokens](/userguide/api/access-tokens.html)

An access tokens allows users to temporarily grant permissions to other users to act on their
behalf. An access token grants a user the same permissions to a webstrate as the user who generated
the access token.

## [Restoration and Deletion](/userguide/api/restore-delete.html)

Webstrates has very fine-grained versioning control, saving every key stroke in the operations
history. This allows users to restore documents to previous versions (or tags). A complete deletion
of a webstrate is also possible.
